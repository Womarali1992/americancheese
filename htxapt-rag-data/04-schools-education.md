# School Report Cards

The school report card (SRC) combines accountability ratings, data from the Texas Academic Performance Reports (TAPR), and financial information to give a broad view of campus performance. Available for each campus in Texas, the SRC is intended specifically to inform parents and guardians about a school’s individual characteristics and its academic performance.  The inclusion of a cover letter with the SRC is not required, but many schools find it helpful to provide one. A sample cover letter to families is available in both [English](https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/accountability/academic-accountability/performance-reporting/2024-and-2025-src-sample-letter-english.docx) and [Spanish](https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/accountability/academic-accountability/performance-reporting/2024-and-2025-src-sample-letter-spanish.docx).

The [**2023-2024 and 2024-2025 school report cards**](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/src/src_srch.html) are available.

The school report card definitions, updated each year, explain several of the terms used in the SRC. Updated versions are available:

- [2024 School Report Card Definitions](https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/accountability/academic-accountability/performance-reporting/2024-src-definitions-english.pdf)
- [2025 School Report Card Definitions](https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/accountability/academic-accountability/performance-reporting/2025-src-definitions-english.pdf)

Spanish versions are also available:

- [2024 Spanish School Report Card Definitions](https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/accountability/academic-accountability/performance-reporting/2024-src-definitions-spanish.pdf)
- [2025 Spanish School Report Card Definitions](https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/accountability/academic-accountability/performance-reporting/2025-src-definitions-spanish.pdf)

The U.S. Department of Education also requires an annual report card with specific district- and campus-level data. The [2024-25 federal report cards](https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/accountability/academic-accountability/performance-reporting/federal-report-cards) were released in December 2025.

# Texas Academic Performance Reports

The **Texas Academic Performance Reports (TAPR)** pull together a wide range of information on the performance of students in each school and district in Texas every year. Performance is shown disaggregated by student groups, including ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The reports also provide extensive information on school and district staff, programs, and student demographics.

The [2024–25 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2025/index.html) are available for the state and every public school, district, or region of Texas.

Final TAPR for the following school years are currently available:

[2023-24 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2024/index.html) \| [2022–23 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2023/index.html) \| [2021–22 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2022/index.html) \| [2020–21 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2021/index.html) \| [2019–20 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2020/index.html) \| [2018–19 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2019/index.html "2017–18 TAPR") \| [2017–18 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2018/index.html "2017–18 TAPR") \| [2016–17 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2017/index.html "2016–17 TAPR") \| [2015–16 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2016/index.html) \| [2014–15 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2015/index.html) \| [2013–14 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2014/index.html) \| [2012–13 TAPR](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2013/index.html)

The TAPR was previously known as the Academic Excellence Indicator System (AEIS) Reports. Those reports were published from 2003–04 to 2011–12. They may be found at the [AEIS Archive](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/aeis/index.html "AEIS Archive").

The Texas Performance Reporting System (TPRS) will also be updated on a rolling basis as more current data become available.

- ### 2025-2026 Tax Rate Adoption


FORT BEND ISD ADOPTED A TAX RATE THAT WILL RAISE MORE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S TAX RATE. THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY 3.33 PERCENT AND WILL RAISE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY APPROXIMATELY $70.00

"The district adopted a total tax rate of $1.0569, which is above the $0.9869 Voter Approval Tax Rate. However, because the district is in an area that was declared a disaster in 2024 and federal aid was requested, state law allows the district to adopt this higher rate without automatically holding an election. The district conducted a public meeting and followed all required notice and transparency rules."

# Home

HISD is proud to be a rapidly improving school system. As of August 2025, there are **no longer** F rated campuses in HISD and 75% of HISD students walk into in A & B rated schools each morning. These results are due to our commitment to providing every student high-quality instruction every day.

HISD families can count on HISD schools to provide safe and caring learning environments where students are challenged and encouraged. Educators and staff are held to high expectations and in turn do the same for every child.

Our school-based staff are ready and eager to support families through their HISD experience. If additional assistance is needed, parents can reach out to the **Family Connections Center at 713-556-7121**.

Amazing leaders. Amazing experiences.

Amazing leaders. Amazing experiences.





Spring Branch Independent School District (SBISD) is proud to recognize Liz Goodman, named 2026 Elementary Principal of the Year, and Roy Moore, named 2026 Secondary Principal of the Year.

Together, they reflect the people-centered leadership that defines SBISD and show how strong leadership at the school level directly shapes the daily experience of students, staff, and families. When schools have great leaders, great things happen for kids.

Both Goodman and Moore were selected for this honor by their fellow principals and school leaders. Their recognition reflects the respect they have earned from peers across SBISD and highlights the shared professionalism, collaboration, and high expectations that define leadership across our schools.





Goodman has built a career in education spanning 28 years, serving students as both a classroom teacher and campus leader. Throughout her time in SBISD, she has focused on creating learning environments where students are known, supported, and encouraged to grow academically and socially.

At Wilchester Elementary School, Goodman has strengthened campus culture by supporting intentional instructional practices, building strong partnerships with families, and creating opportunities for teachers and staff to lead and learn together. Her leadership emphasizes consistency, kindness, and clear expectations that help every student feel safe, capable, and ready to learn.

“I believe every child should walk into school feeling welcomed, respected, and confident that this is a place where they can grow academically and socially. Our work at Wilchester is about lifting up every learner and building strong partnerships with families and staff so that students are excited about what’s possible for them.”

SBISD is proud to honor Liz Goodman for the impact she has on students, the culture she has built at Wilchester, and the example she sets across the district.





Moore brings 26 years of experience in public education to his work in SBISD. He began his career as a special education teacher and coach before moving into campus leadership as an assistant principal and principal. In SBISD, he previously served at Nottingham Elementary School and later at Landrum Middle School, where he focused on strengthening campus culture, academic expectations, and staff collaboration.

This school year, Moore stepped into a new role as principal of Spring Forest Middle School, leading the campus through a year of transition and renewed focus. His work has centered on building strong relationships with students and families, supporting teachers, and setting clear expectations for learning and behavior that help students succeed.

“I’m focused on reestablishing who we are and what we expect from our Bobcats. There have been a lot of changes at Spring Forest, and I am excited to chart a new direction and create a culture that is committed to improving student achievement at the highest levels. The best is yet to come.”

SBISD is proud to recognize Roy Moore for his dedication to students, his leadership across campuses, and his vision for the future of Spring Forest Middle School.

Congratulations to Liz Goodman and Roy Moore, two outstanding leaders who reflect the very best of SBISD.

Their work shows what is possible when schools are guided by leaders who care deeply about students, support their staff, and stay focused on what matters most, helping Every Child succeed.

Career exploration in SBISD begins early. At this year’s Children’s Barnyard, Pre-K through first grade students experienced hands-on learning at the Agricultural Science Center, guided by CTE and FFA students who modeled leadership and real-world skills.

Events like this reflect SBISD’s commitment to early exposure, meaningful learning, and preparing students for future pathways.
