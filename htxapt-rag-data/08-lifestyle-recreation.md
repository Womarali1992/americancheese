## It’s, per usual, a very exciting time in Houston dining.

Houston restaurants are home to chefs recognized by the James Beard Foundation as well as hometown wunderkinds doing riffs on [Third Coast](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/houston/best-seafood-restaurants-in-houston-tx) and [Tejano classics](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/houston/most-underrated-tex-mex-food-restaurants-houston-texas). Some of the most badass talent in the city dish it out in the city’s two [Asiatowns](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/houston/best-chinatown-restaurants-houston). The restaurant landscape here is more than robust. Our latest lineup of best places to eat in Houston right now includes a sexy live-fire steakhouse, washeteria-turned–Asian American spot, plus a pizza and crudo joint from a much-missed familiar face. Here’s where you want to eat in Houston at this very moment.

Heights

An old 1955 washeteria being revamped into an impossibly cool new Asian American restaurant is just so Houston _we can’t even_. The hot ticket comes from culinary savants chef Evelyn Garcia (a _Top Chef_ hometown hero) and Bronx native and chef-partner Henry Lu, who explore their heritage and upbringings to create a new kind of food culture. Settle into serene, organic space and awaken the palate with oysters and fermented mango, Chinese sausage and rice noodles, and your new favorite fried chicken, hit with shrimp paste, Thai chili, and ginger.

Midtown

$$$$

Houston’s innovative Ion District just got even more ground-breaking with the addition of veteran chef David Cordúa’s latest sensation. True to the chef’s signature style, the plush all-day restaurant, bar, and lounge celebrates the rich heritage of Latin and Mediterranean cuisine in elevated form. Dishes include Stuffed Chicken Ballotine, Sweet Corn Flan, and an old school Cordúa family favorite, the Churrasco beef with chimichurri, pickled onion, and bernaise.

Rice Village

$$$$

Fans of Aaron Bludorn will be happy to know there’s another place to enjoy his skillful, transcendent cuisine. Piggybacking off the success of his first Houston restaurant, the namesake Bludorn in Montrose, the talented chef and restaurateur turns his focus to the gems of the Gulf Coast for his bright faced Rice Village spot, set in the space formerly occupied by Politan Row. Bludorn and executive chef Jerrod Zifchak (a fellow [Café Boulud](https://www.cafeboulud.com/) alum) have collaborated on a seafood heavy menu that sings. Swordfish Au Poivre with green peppercorn sauce, Linguini Vongole, and Seafood Risotto, and what feels like the restaurant’s signature dish, a pot pie-style Mussel Bisque served piping hot and topped with gorgeously golden puff pastry are a few of the highlights.

[**5Kinokawa**](https://www.thrillist.com/venues/5kinokawa-5076235)

Heights

$$$$

After gaining fans at the since-closed Blackbird Izakaya and continuing to impress at Hidden Omakase, chef Billy Kin opened this omakase experience in the former Golden Bagels locale on White Oak, along with former Degust chef Brandon Silva. A more casual izakaya, Tesseract, is set to join the space next. With high quality ingredients flown in weekly from Japan’s Toyosu Market, expect flawless preparations of fatty otoro (tuna belly), A5 Wagyu, tako (octopus), and fresh uni. Speaking of uni, if you’re lucky, the night will include a bite of Kin’s incredibly silky Uni Pasta, a redux of his famous Blackbird Izakaya Uni Carbonara. Bring your own booze and gear up for a good time.

[**Nobie's**](https://www.thrillist.com/venues/eat/houston/restaurants/nobies)

Montrose

$$$$

Is it just us, or does this playful date night (and late night) staple just keep getting better with age? Executive chef Martin Stayer takes inspiration from his grandmother, Nobie, to put out masterful, locally kissed plates and bountiful shareables that’ll keep you coming back for more. Pretty much everyone starts with an order of Dilly Bread, puffy pull-apart milk bread that you can (and should) pair with smoked trout roe, but don’t let the harissa-spiced beer-battered Sweet Potato Tots fly under the radar. One dish that definitely doesn’t fly under the radar? Nonno’s Pasta, the tagliatelle bolognese is a staple on the ever-changing menu. Get some of that, and some of whatever’s in season, whether that be Beets by Dr Pepper or the Let’s Meat Hanger Steak Au Poivre. It’s all ending with one of the best damn pies you’ve had in your life, regardless.

Museum District

$$$$

Culinary director and Michelin-starred chef Alain Verzeroli, who worked under late culinary legend Jöel Robuchon for nearly 20 years, harnesses the power of peak-season ingredients at this artful French restaurant, with Felipe Botero Sanchezas acting as the new chef de cuisine. Tucked away in the Museum of Fine Arts campus, guests can wine and dine in full view of the majestic sculpture garden. With Le Jardinier—French for “the gardener”—sporting a menu of well-balanced creations, guests with diverse palettes will have no problem scoring a dish overflowing with nutrients. Seafood lovers can bask in the buttery King Kampachi, emblazoned with squash and white sesame, while health nuts can slice into a grass-fed Tenderloin partnered with nutty ratte potatoes and gem lettuce. Pastry chef—and fellow Michelin Star recipient—Salvatore Martone’s desserts, like the Venezuelen Dark Chocolate Crémeux draped in salty caramel sabayon, are equally as stunning.

Montrose

$$$$

The Goodnight Hospitality team’s (Rosie Cannonball, Montrose Cheese & Wine) stunning Mediterranean tasting menu emporium is one of the most, if not the most, special dining experiences in Houston. Chef-partner Felipe Riccio whisks diners through a modern, travel-oriented journey in six or nine courses, which have traveled from Levant regional specialties like Snapper Crudo with chermoula to the South France’s historic Occitania region’s plates like fatty Cod Belly Brandade. Overseen by an all-star team spanning beverage director Mark Sayre, master sommelier and partner June Rodil, and bar manager Chad Matson, the wine and cocktail programs are also of note, making good use of the 11,000-bottle-deep cellar lurking below.

[**Blood Bros BBQ**](https://www.thrillist.com/venues/blood-bros-bbq-5062006)

Bellaire

$$$$

The brainchild of Chinese American brothers Robin and Terry Wong alongside pitmaster Quy Hoang, Blood Bros BBQ is a critically acclaimed Asian-inflected ‘cue joint. Beyond staples like Brisket Fried Rice and the pulled pork–stuffed Pig Moe Sandwich, recent offerings have included Vietnamese Thit Nuong Pork Belly done in the style of burnt ends and Mexican-inspired Seared Octopus served with chimichurri and street corn.

[**Bludorn**](https://www.thrillist.com/venues/bludorn-5056365)

Montrose

$$$$

Two years in and chef Aaron Bludorn’s namesake New American restaurant remains a reliable stunner. It’s the first solo project for the former Café Boulud chef, who is married to Victoria Pappas of the local Pappas restaurant empire. Set in the former Pass & Provisions space on Taft, it’s where Bludorn and co. show off skillful European technique alongside a much-welcomed punch of Gulf Coast love. Next level dishes include a rotating Foie Gras and pastry, Lobster Pot Pie, and Short Rib Ravioli, as well as a [Baked Alaska you never knew you needed](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/houston/houston-restaurant-bucket-list).

East End

$$$$

Chef Benchawan Jabthong Painter, who grew up in Thailand and cut her chops at spots like Theodore Rex, dishes out unapologetically traditional Thai cuisine at this street food mecca in the far East End. It recently earned her a James Beard Award for “Best Chef Texas.” When Painter says her food is “unapologetically Thai,” she means she’s not using any sugary, watered down, readymade short cuts. Everything is legit made from scratch in her kitchen, from the spicy Northeastern-style Larb and perfect Shrimp Pad Thai and fiery Green Curry with Roti Bread to sop it all up.

Galleria

$$$$

The duo behind Dubai’s Spice Route Co. tapped rising star chef Mayank Istwal to show off the fare of his native India in an over-the-top dining experience set over 10,000 square feet of gorgeously ornate interior and terrace space with antique rugs, empire ceilings lit by chandeliers, and a “Palace of Mirrors'' room with more than 200,000 pieces of hand-cut mirror on its walls. A reflective mix of traditional and cutting edge dishes match the majestic atmosphere at this extraordinary Indian concept. Expect dramatic presentations of Pani Puri (filled with fresh ceviche, no less), gorgeous Stuffed Squash Blossoms, fiery Smoked Goat, and the Butter Chicken Experience with the classic done multiple ways; plus power lunches, social hours, and multi-course tasting menus from the chef.

The mod, Euro-style bistro comes from the powerhouse trio behind Better Luck Tomorrow, which includes bar genius Bobby Heugel, culinary whiz Justin Yu, and restaurateur Steve Flippo. With a kitchen backed by Mark Clayton and team, menu offerings should certainly hit the spot with choices like Pasta a la Béarnaise, Mussels Bruschetta, and a fantastic Sunday brunch. The French Cheeseburger may be one of the best in town, featuring a perfectly fatty beef patty and a gorgeous house-baked pain de mie bun made even more impressive with an oozing cascade of Raclette cheese. All of it is paired with a great selection of retail-priced wine to boot.

Israeli and Middle Eastern street food is gussied up and polished at this modern, Tel Aviv-inspired stunner from the masterful team behind Doris Metropolitan and Rice Village neighbor, Bādolina Bakery & Cafe. Starting with a mosaic of salatim (Israeli snacks) and small plates—think Lamb Hummus, Moroccan Matbucha, and Arak Mussels—is absolutely the way to go here, followed by larger selections like Lamb Spare Ribs, Grilled Branzino, and the za'atar butter basted Beef Skewers pierced by a miniature sword. Those looking for an extra special experience can book the “Yalla Yalla” six-seat chef’s table, which offers a prime view of the brick oven and chef-curated selection of plates.

River Oaks

Jewel-toned chandeliers and sultry red silk shaded lamps set the mood for luxury at this bold new River Oaks spot, from the family behind Mary’z Mediterranean restaurant and with chef-consultant Mark Cox of the late, great Mark’s. Expect local riffs on the traditional cuisines bordering the Mediterranean Sea on its menu full of shareable hot and cold mezze and mains. Gorgeous Feta Dumplings sit on a bed of citrus labne, King Trumpet Mushroom Shawarma and the Halal-certified Texas Wagyu Ribeye are showstoppers, and drinks like the Grand Bazaar, with rye whiskey, fino sherry, sweet vermouth and angostura bitters, are something you should highly consider adding to your experience.

An old 1955 washeteria being revamped into an impossibly cool new Asian American restaurant is just so Houston _we can’t even_. The hot ticket comes from culinary savants chef Evelyn Garcia (a _Top Chef_ hometown hero) and Bronx native and chef-partner Henry Lu, who explore their heritage and upbringings to create a new kind of food culture. Settle into serene, organic space and awaken the palate with oysters and fermented mango, Chinese sausage and rice noodles, and your new favorite fried chicken, hit with shrimp paste, Thai chili, and ginger.

![The Lymbar](https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/3132955/156x116/flatten;crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg)

## The Lymbar

Houston’s innovative Ion District just got even more ground-breaking with the addition of veteran chef David Cordúa’s latest sensation. True to the chef’s signature style, the plush all-day restaurant, bar, and lounge celebrates the rich heritage of Latin and Mediterranean cuisine in elevated form. Dishes include Stuffed Chicken Ballotine, Sweet Corn Flan, and an old school Cordúa family favorite, the Churrasco beef with chimichurri, pickled onion, and bernaise.

## Navy Blue

Fans of Aaron Bludorn will be happy to know there’s another place to enjoy his skillful, transcendent cuisine. Piggybacking off the success of his first Houston restaurant, the namesake Bludorn in Montrose, the talented chef and restaurateur turns his focus to the gems of the Gulf Coast for his bright faced Rice Village spot, set in the space formerly occupied by Politan Row. Bludorn and executive chef Jerrod Zifchak (a fellow [Café Boulud](https://www.cafeboulud.com/) alum) have collaborated on a seafood heavy menu that sings. Swordfish Au Poivre with green peppercorn sauce, Linguini Vongole, and Seafood Risotto, and what feels like the restaurant’s signature dish, a pot pie-style Mussel Bisque served piping hot and topped with gorgeously golden puff pastry are a few of the highlights.

## 5Kinokawa

After gaining fans at the since-closed Blackbird Izakaya and continuing to impress at Hidden Omakase, chef Billy Kin opened this omakase experience in the former Golden Bagels locale on White Oak, along with former Degust chef Brandon Silva. A more casual izakaya, Tesseract, is set to join the space next. With high quality ingredients flown in weekly from Japan’s Toyosu Market, expect flawless preparations of fatty otoro (tuna belly), A5 Wagyu, tako (octopus), and fresh uni. Speaking of uni, if you’re lucky, the night will include a bite of Kin’s incredibly silky Uni Pasta, a redux of his famous Blackbird Izakaya Uni Carbonara. Bring your own booze and gear up for a good time.

## Nobie's

Is it just us, or does this playful date night (and late night) staple just keep getting better with age? Executive chef Martin Stayer takes inspiration from his grandmother, Nobie, to put out masterful, locally kissed plates and bountiful shareables that’ll keep you coming back for more. Pretty much everyone starts with an order of Dilly Bread, puffy pull-apart milk bread that you can (and should) pair with smoked trout roe, but don’t let the harissa-spiced beer-battered Sweet Potato Tots fly under the radar. One dish that definitely doesn’t fly under the radar? Nonno’s Pasta, the tagliatelle bolognese is a staple on the ever-changing menu. Get some of that, and some of whatever’s in season, whether that be Beets by Dr Pepper or the Let’s Meat Hanger Steak Au Poivre. It’s all ending with one of the best damn pies you’ve had in your life, regardless.

Culinary director and Michelin-starred chef Alain Verzeroli, who worked under late culinary legend Jöel Robuchon for nearly 20 years, harnesses the power of peak-season ingredients at this artful French restaurant, with Felipe Botero Sanchezas acting as the new chef de cuisine. Tucked away in the Museum of Fine Arts campus, guests can wine and dine in full view of the majestic sculpture garden. With Le Jardinier—French for “the gardener”—sporting a menu of well-balanced creations, guests with diverse palettes will have no problem scoring a dish overflowing with nutrients. Seafood lovers can bask in the buttery King Kampachi, emblazoned with squash and white sesame, while health nuts can slice into a grass-fed Tenderloin partnered with nutty ratte potatoes and gem lettuce. Pastry chef—and fellow Michelin Star recipient—Salvatore Martone’s desserts, like the Venezuelen Dark Chocolate Crémeux draped in salty caramel sabayon, are equally as stunning.

The Goodnight Hospitality team’s (Rosie Cannonball, Montrose Cheese & Wine) stunning Mediterranean tasting menu emporium is one of the most, if not the most, special dining experiences in Houston. Chef-partner Felipe Riccio whisks diners through a modern, travel-oriented journey in six or nine courses, which have traveled from Levant regional specialties like Snapper Crudo with chermoula to the South France’s historic Occitania region’s plates like fatty Cod Belly Brandade. Overseen by an all-star team spanning beverage director Mark Sayre, master sommelier and partner June Rodil, and bar manager Chad Matson, the wine and cocktail programs are also of note, making good use of the 11,000-bottle-deep cellar lurking below.

A reflective mix of traditional and cutting edge dishes match the majestic atmosphere at this extraordinary Indian concept. Expect dramatic presentations of Pani Puri (filled with fresh ceviche, no less), gorgeous Stuffed Squash Blossoms, fiery Smoked Goat, and the Butter Chicken Experience with the classic done multiple ways; plus power lunches, social hours, and multi-course tasting menus from the chef.

# I Checked Into a Postpartum Retreat—Here’s Why Every New Mom Should Consider It

## Ahma & Co helped me heal after baby number two—and proved why postpartum care should start with the mother

By [Ramona Saviss](https://www.thrillist.com/authors/ramona-saviss)

“How’s the pressure?” the massage therapist asked as she gently worked the knots in my back, pushing me toward a state of pure relaxation. “Amazing,” I managed to whisper, which was, in fact, amazing, considering I had given birth less than a month before, and up until this weekend had been utterly exhausted and overwhelmed. But a day earlier I had checked myself and my new son into a postpartum retreat, [Ahma & Co](https://www.ahmaandco.com/), at the Waldorf Astoria Monarch Beach Resort & Club in Dana Point, California. I had come to rest and be revived, to ease into second-time motherhood and not feel so alone. Here, the emphasis would be on me, not as much on my baby, though he’d obviously be well taken care of.

While I didn’t have any complications after the birth of my first son in 2022, I was stressed, anxious, and felt unsupported. I hired two night nurses for two weeks each, but they were inexperienced and unenthusiastic and didn’t end up helping much at all. Afterward I began hearing more and more about postpartum retreats and care centers focused on the mother’s wellbeing, often located within luxury hotels. There was one in New York, another in [Santa Monica](https://www.sanhuhouse.com/), one that just opened in San Francisco. The more I read, the more I knew that I would book one when I had my next child.

### A History of Supporting Mothers

While it’s not common in the U.S., postpartum care is a prevalent practice all over the world. In Korea, sanhujori dates back thousands of years. Generally the new mother’s family would come and take care of her and her new baby—cooking, cleaning, helping with the newborn—for 40 days. The belief is rooted in the notion that it takes 40 days for a woman to regain strength and recover from childbirth. But as the traditional extended family system dissolved over the years, paid postpartum centers, or sanhujoriwon, became popular. Now, [eight in 10 women in Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/28/world/asia/south-korea-joriwon-postpartum-care.html) go to a sanhujoriwonafter giving birth. Many stay for 21 days, or two to three weeks, though they may continue to rest for the remainder of the full 40 days at home.

In China, a similar tradition is observed, zuò yuèzi, which literally translates to "sitting the month." The centuries-old practice emphasizes rest and recovery for the new mother—she’s expected to stay indoors, eat special warming foods, and avoid physical exertion. In Japan, the afterbirth care of a new mother is known as ansei (quiet rest) or satogaeri bunben, which translates to “returning home to give birth.” Many first-time mothers return to their parents' home for familial support for the first one to two months.

In Latin America, this time is known as la cuarentena (the quarantine), where the attention is on healing and bonding with the baby. Middle Eastern cultures also observe the 40 days of rest, and Israel recently welcomed a postpartum care facility, a “baby hotel,” called [Baby Lis](https://www.babylis.co.il/en). Most of these cultures have similar protocols for the new mother, such as eating healing foods, avoiding cold environments, belly binding or wrapping, and getting rest through massages and various therapies, all while having a support system to help care for the newborn.

In most European countries, postpartum care is an essential part of the healthcare system. In France, for example, the healthcare system emphasizes perineal health and abdominal muscle rehabilitation post-birth. New moms get home visits by one or two midwives in the first week after birth, followed by 10 sessions of pelvic floor and abdominal muscle rehab—all of it covered by national insurance. In The Netherlands, a kraamverzorgster (maternity nurse), comes to a new mother’s home typically for 24 hours total throughout the first postpartum week to help with everything from newborn care and breast feeding to light housekeeping and mental health care.

In the U.S., meanwhile, postpartum care generally means one checkup six weeks after a woman gives birth, and according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, nearly [40 percent of mothers miss it](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2018/05/optimizing-postpartum-care).

> [A post shared by The Village Postnatal Retreat Center (@villagepostnatalretreat)](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKh7b3nySA2/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

But this is starting to change—at least, for people who can afford it.

[Boram Care](https://boramcare.com/) in New York opened in 2022 and is considered one of the first postpartum retreats in the U.S. It’s located within the Park Lane Hotel and offers hotel suites outfitted for new moms, along with 24/7 support from trained postpartum doulas, nutritious meals, and wellness services like abdominal therapy and lactation support. Over the past few years a handful of retreats have opened across the country, including The [Village Postnatal Retreat Center](https://villageretreatcenter.com/) in San Francisco, [Fourth Trimester](https://fourthretreat.com/) in Chicago, [Haven Postnatal Retreat](https://havenpostnatal.com/) in Atlanta, and [Yuzi](https://www.yuzicare.com/) in Seattle, among others. Typically each retreat costs near $1,000 per night, with rates fluctuating depending on length of stay (the longer the stay, the lower the nightly rate). Most new moms or parents check in for a minimum of three nights.

When I read about Ahma & Co, I knew it was the retreat for me—and not just because it’s located in one of my favorite hotels. It was founded in 2024 by Esther Park, a Harvard Business School grad who has trained as a doula. “Growing up in South Korea and having spent the beginning of my adulthood there, where postpartum care is a cherished tradition and recognized rite of passage, I realized that the reality for mothers here could very well be different if we could introduce the model of the postpartum retreat to the U.S.,” Park told me. “It made me wonder—how could I ever envision becoming a mom in this environment? Ahma & Co is my love note to mothers, and to my future family that my husband and I hope to build.”

### What to Expect at a Postpartum Retreat

I booked my stay with Ahma & Co about three months before my due date. They recommend expectant mothers book three to six months in advance and stay in touch throughout their pregnancy. I had a call with a care coordinator (Gigi, a doula and community lead), who conducted a thorough intake interview and helped set up tentative dates based on my estimated due date.

Ahma & Co takes no more than five newborns at a time and always has at least two doulas working (more depending on the number of babies). They transformed a designated hotel room to be their lounge and main hub, using it as a community room and nursery for the babies. The suites surrounding the lounge are regular hotel rooms that are outfitted with products for retreat guests. Mothers are welcome to come alone or with a guest (usually a spouse, partner, parent, or friend). As this was my second baby, I opted to go solo while my husband stayed home with our toddler.

When I checked in with my one-month-old baby, my doula Joselyn, who goes by Yose, was waiting for me in the valet and helped unload my car. The room was fully equipped with everything a new mom would need: a station with pillows and a pump (the Spectra S1, the same one I have at home), a monogrammed bathrobe for my son (more for a photo op than practical use), a Keekaroo diaper changing station, Coterie diapers and wipes in the bedside bassinet, a Tomarion II infrared heating pad for low back pain, sanitary pads, and packs of Earth Mama herbal sitz bath. My itinerary, printed out and waiting for me, included a welcoming herbal foot soak, a full-body massage from a postpartum specialist the next day, and a baby reflexology course.

I took a moment to enjoy a welcome snack, rose-flavored energy balls by Chiyo, known for their hormone-supporting ingredients and women-focused nutrition rooted in Eastern food therapy, that were in a small basket alongside herbal teas and tonics, before Yose came and asked if she should call for my dinner of warming foods: seaweed soup and spicy beef short ribs on a bed of black rice. She shared that she became a postpartum doula following the birth of her first child. “I connected with my Mexican Indigenous ancestry and learned about traditional birth and postpartum practices passed down through generations,” she said. For her this included belly binding, a traditional practice of wrapping the abdomen tightly to promote healing following childbirth.

Yose asked if I wanted her to take my son to the nursery, located just a couple of doors down, so I could get some rest. She pointed out the in-room tablet which had access to a Nanit camera stationed above a bassinet in the nursery. I felt uncertain handing my newborn over so soon and opted to take care of him for the night.

Overnight, even being alone, just knowing that there was someone down the hall who could help take care of my baby gave me a sense of calm. Surprisingly my baby ate and slept with ease, perhaps picking up on my tranquil energy.

The next day, I handed my son to the doulas for some rest while I enjoyed that much-needed massage. Following lunch (they provide three meals a day, plus snacks), I joined a workshop on baby reflexology and met a couple who had checked in for five days. They were first-time parents from Florida and Sydney, who, with little family nearby, decided to stay at Ahma & Co. straight from the hospital, for guidance on newborn care.

Park told me they see a lot of guests who are first-time parents needing this kind of support. It’s almost like a crash course in taking care of babies—what the hospital tries to teach you while you’re in a post-delivery haze, but with a much more expansive and supportive approach. “Maternal care is focused on pregnancy and the birth—there is such a significant gap in postpartum, when mothers and parents are often left with very little support or guidance for not just newborn care, but their own recovery,” said Park of the current U.S. healthcare system. “We get to see firsthand how much of a difference the right support can make—families arrive exhausted and uncertain, and by the time they leave, they’re more rested, more confident, and better equipped for this new chapter. It's humbling to see that what we’re building is giving parents a stronger start, and we're grateful to play a part in normalizing postpartum care and redefining the motherhood experience.”

For me, the experience provided extra quality time to spend with my son and take care of myself—something I truly relished. I was given the space to heal and recalibrate post-birth. Even just a couple of nights at Ahma & Co helped me learn how to slow down and focus on myself while I also bonding with my baby.

As I merged onto the freeway heading home—an hour drive I had initially dreaded before my visit to Ahma & Co—my son began to cry. But I knew he’d be OK, and so would I. After my stay, I found myself in a different mental space: calm, grounded, and ready to embrace my new role as a mom of two under two with confidence and peace.

Our work weaves together green spaces, trails, and reimagined industrial relics that serve as portals to Houston’s diverse history and neighborhoods. These projects create common ground along our waterway — spaces we all share, cultivated through collaboration, innovation, and enduring investment in Houston’s communities. There’s something for everyone here.

## Trails

Walk, run, or bike on Houston's extensive trail system. The Houston Parks and Recreation Department maintains over 163.12 miles of trails that loop within parks or run along streets and bayous. Whether you have marathon training, a bike ride, or a short dog walk in mind (please remember leash and cleanup laws!), you will find a trail perfect for your needs in your neighborhood park or along a nearby linear trail. Park trails are surfaced with either asphalt, concrete, crushed granite, or red dog.

**NOTE:** All HPARD trails are multi-use unless otherwise posted at locations. Please share the trail and respect other trail users.
