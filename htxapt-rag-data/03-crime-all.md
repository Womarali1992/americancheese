Notes:

- The Houston Police Department does not recommend
raw data comparisons be made between police beats. This web
site does not provide a comparative analysis of the various
beats.
- If you plan to print out the crime statistic
tables, for best results, choose the "landscape" orientation
from the properties menu in your printer dialogue box.
- ZIP code boundaries and police beat boundaries
do not correspond. ZIP code boundaries may overlap beat boundaries
and there may be several beats within several ZIP codes and
vice versa. ZIP codes are provided only as a reference.
- PLEASE NOTE: In accordance with the national shift in crime data collection and reporting methods, the Houston Police Department is currently transitioning from UCR to NIBRS ahead of the FBI’s 2021 deadline. The publication of summary crime data and departmental reports has been delayed due to this transition. Crime data for June 2018 and the months following will be provided as soon as the department is granted state certification under the NIBRS data collection method.

Notes:

- The Houston Police Department does not recommend
raw data comparisons be made between police beats. This web
site does not provide a comparative analysis of the various
beats.
- If you plan to print out the crime statistic
tables, for best results, choose the "landscape" orientation
from the properties menu in your printer dialogue box.
- ZIP code boundaries and police beat boundaries
do not correspond. ZIP code boundaries may overlap beat boundaries
and there may be several beats within several ZIP codes and
vice versa. ZIP codes are provided only as a reference.
- PLEASE NOTE: In accordance with the national shift in crime data collection and reporting methods, the Houston Police Department is currently transitioning from UCR to NIBRS ahead of the FBI’s 2021 deadline. The publication of summary crime data and departmental reports has been delayed due to this transition. Crime data for June 2018 and the months following will be provided as soon as the department is granted state certification under the NIBRS data collection method.

Beat Description and Boundary:

Note: In August, 2005, 6B50 was
split into two beats at the North Sam Houston Parkway with the
new northern beat designated as 6B60

The boundary begins at the city limits
on the north side of N BW 8 W (North Sam Houston Parkway West)
between Ella Blvd and Sharmon. (Key Map 372T) The boundary follows
the city limits north, then west to a point just east of Lilleux.
At this point, the boundary then travels north along the city
limits line, then west, back north along the 11100 block of Lilleux,
then east, and back north to just south of Gears Road.

(Along Lilleux Rd, 6B60 is only responsible for the even (east)
addresses from 11130 to 11140. Harris County is responsible for
the even (east) addresses up to 11128, and then from 11142, and
the odd (west) addresses).

The boundary then turns east and follows the city limits north
of Gears Road to Greens Bayou.

(Both sides of Gears Road are the responsibility of 6B60.)

The boundary then follows Greens Bayou in a northeasterly direction
to West Greens Road. Then the boundary turns east on West Greens
Road to a point just east of the intersection of Donna and Greens
Road. The boundary then turns north, then west back to Greens
Bayou and follows Greens Bayou northeasterly, then back south
to Greens Road.

(Both sides of Greens Road are the responsibility of 6B60.)

The boundary then turns east along the north side of Greens Road
for several blocks to just east of the intersection of Homar and
Greens Road.

It then turns north to the Gibralter Saving Association property
line and along the Forest Edge M.U.D line to where it turns west
following the city limits south of Rushcreek Drive. It then follows
the city limits line traveling north then west parallel to Rushcreek
Drive to Spears-Gears Road.

(From 900-1200 Rushcreek Dr, 6B60 is responsible for the even
(north) addresses, and Harris County is responsible for the odd
(south) addresses.)

The boundary then goes north on Spears-Gears Road to the line
for H.C. MUD 200/city limits line.

(Addresses on the even (east) side of Spears-Gears Rd. are the
responsibility of 6B60, and odd (west) addresses are Harris County.)

The boundary turns east just south of Clearvalley and follows
the city limits line to just east of Ella Boulevard.

The boundary then turns north, then east across Greens Bayou drainage
easement, then south and east to just west of Kuykendahl Road.
The city limits turn northwest along Kuykendahl Road, then turns
north and east on the H.C. MUD 215 line following the city limits
line to N IH 45 (North Freeway).

(Even addresses on the northeast side of Kuykendahl and the roadway,
are the responsibility of 6B60, and the odd addresses on the southwest
side are Harris County).

The beat boundary goes south along I-45 to a point just north
of Rankin Road, turns east, then south to Rankin Road and I-45.
It then continues south on I-45 to Glenborough Drive.

(From the 14200 block to the 13900 block, Harris County is responsible
for the main lanes and all even (east) addresses. 6B60 is responsible
for all odd (west) addresses except for a point in the 14200 block
where Harris County assumes responsibility.

In the 13700 and 13800 blocks, 6B60 is responsible for all addresses
and the main lanes.

From the 13600 block to the 12600 block, 6B60 is responsible for
the odd (west) addresses and the southbound service road. Harris
County is responsible for the even (east) addresses, the northbound
service road, and the main lanes going in both directions.

At the 12500 block, 6B60 is responsible for the odd (west) and
even (east) addresses and the north and southbound service roads.
Harris County is responsible for the main lanes. 6B60 is responsible
for all addresses and the main lanes from the 12400 block southbound.)

At Glenborough Drive, the boundary turns straight east off of
I-45. Then it follows the H.C. MUD 101 boundary and city limits
line east, and then north along Greenchase Drive.

(6B60 is responsible for addresses on both sides of Greenchase)

The beat boundary continues east then south to the 600 block of
Harvest Time Lane. The boundary then turns east, just north of
Langwick Drive to the railroad tracks along East Hardy Road.

(6B60 is responsible for addresses on both sides of Harvest Time
Lane up to the 600 block. From 600-900 Harvest Time, 6B60 is responsible
for the even (south) addresses and the roadway, and Harris County
is responsible for the odd (north) addresses.)

(As annexed under Ordinance-2002-361) The boundary travels south
along the railroad tracks, to Greens Road, then travels east on
Greens Road across the Hardy Toll Road, turns northeasterly along
the city limits line and incorporates a portion of the Greens
Parkway Municipal Utility District (MUD) along East Hardy Road
and the Hardy Toll Road.

The boundary continues to follow the city limits line northeasterly,
then north to a point south of 1500 Rankin Road, and then turns
east and north again to just south of Rankin Road. The city limits
continue east across Central Greens Boulevard and Air Center Boulevard,
to a point just short of, and west of Bliss Station Road. At this
point the boundary turns south and east to a point west of S.
Hubbs. The boundary turns south again following the city limits
line to its intersection with the northerly right-of-way line
of the Hardy/IAH Airport Connector Toll Plaza.

(6B60 is responsible for even (south) addresses from 1576 to the
1700 block of Rankin Road. Harris County is responsible for the
even (south) addresses from 1500 to 1574. The roadway and the
odd (north) addresses between 1500 and 1700 Rankin Road are the
responsibility of Harris County.)

Connector’s roadway and the on/off entrance- exit ramps
are the responsibilities of Harris County. The Hardy/IAH Airport
Connector’s westbound north-side and eastbound south-side
service roads, where applicable, are the responsibilities of 7C50).

The boundary travels south across the Hardy/IAH Airport Connector
following the city limits line southerly to the north right of
way line of Greens Road, then travels east, then back south of
Greens Road, along the east perimeter of a 65 feet wide strip
of land. It then turns west, and travels back north along the
west perimeter of the 65 feet wide strip of land.

The boundary then turns back west along the city limits line,
south of Greens Road, then north, back west, travels parallel
to the south right of way line of Greens Road, and the same line
located north of Old Greens Road.

It continues to follow the city limits line, to Greens Road. At
Greens Road, the boundary travels back west across the Hardy Toll
Road and continues west across the Missouri Pacific Railroad Tracks.

(The Hardy Toll Road and its on/off-entrance/exit-road/ramps are
the responsibilities of Harris County. The Hardy Toll Road southbound
west-side service road where applicable from the city limits line
about .5 miles south of Rankin Road to the southerly right-of-way
line of Aldine Bender Road; and the northbound-eastside service
road from Aldine Bender to Greens Road are the responsibilities
of 7C50.)

Along the west side of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Tracks, the
boundary travels southeasterly to N BW 8 E (North Sam Houston
Parkway East).

The boundary then follows the north side of BW 8 west to the city
limits between Ella Blvd. and Sharmon, where it began.
