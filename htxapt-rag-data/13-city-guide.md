Dig Deeper on Houston

The Houston, TX metro area is a large and bustling place with a lot going on. It was founded back in 1836 and has grown rapidly over the years. Today, it's known for being a big player in the oil and gas industry, but it's also big in healthcare, aerospace, and technology. The city has a strong economy with lots of job opportunities in various sectors.

Geographically, Houston is quite flat and sits near the Gulf of Mexico. This means it has a humid subtropical climate. Summers can get really hot and sticky, while winters are generally mild. Because of its location, Houston sometimes faces hurricanes and heavy rain, which can cause flooding in some areas.

When it comes to voting, Houston is pretty mixed. The city itself often leans towards Democratic candidates, while the surrounding areas might lean more conservative. This makes for an interesting political landscape that reflects the city's wide range of viewpoints.

Living in Houston offers a lot of variety. There's a strong arts and culture scene, with plenty of museums, theaters, and music venues to explore. Sports fans have teams like the Houston Astros (baseball), Houston Rockets (basketball), and Houston Texans (football) to cheer for. The city is also home to a large number of parks and outdoor spaces, perfect for those who love to be outside. Plus, with its location near the Gulf, there are opportunities for water activities too.

For those thinking about moving to Houston, it's important to know a few things. First, be ready for the heat, especially in summer. It's also wise to look into different neighborhoods to find one that fits your lifestyle and budget since the cost of living can vary. Traffic can be a challenge, so think about your commute. And because of the risk of flooding, check if your area requires flood insurance.

Overall, Houston is a place full of opportunity, with a strong job market, a wide range of cultural activities, and a welcoming atmosphere. It's a big city with a lot to offer, but like anywhere, it comes with its own set of challenges to navigate.

**Current Resident:** Never leaving Montrose! Its strength is in its diversity: of people, income levels, food & entertainment options, housing (high rises, townhomes, and large homes). In a largely un-walkable city, the area is very walkable and urban. It's an eclectic neighborhood with the best restaurant scene in the city, and its location is prime, making it quick and easy to access the best of Houston (downtown, uptown, River Oaks, Heights, Rice/Med Center areas all close by). Montrose is changing rapidly, with a constant influx of new houses, apartments, restaurants, and things to do, while also retaining its historical charm with old bungalows and storied institutions. Its public schools are good, and there are several strong private school options in the neighborhood or close by.... Read 31 reviews\\

I like how there are nearby thing such as food, grocery stores, gas statins and even a hospital! One thing I would like to change is the park called American Legion. It has a very big grassy area bt the playground is small to where it gets very boring quickly. They could add water activities such as a community pool or sprinklers to walk through. Overall, I really enjoy living in Greater Heights and its the perfect place to raise a family and go around walking to say hello to the community.... Read 38 reviews\\
