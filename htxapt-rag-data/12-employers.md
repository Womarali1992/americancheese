###### Building the Connectivity Platform for Houston, with Houston



Building a workforce system that expands opportunity requires more than new tools; it requires alignment across people, programs, and pathways.

That belief has guided the Greater Houston Partnership work to co-design the Connectivity Platform alongside stakeholders in Houston’s talent ecosystem. Beginning in 2025 and continuing today, the Partnership has worked with educators, employers, workforce organizations, and community partners to better understand where systems fall short, how decisions are made, and what support students and workers need to navigate opportunity.
