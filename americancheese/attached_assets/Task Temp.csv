PL1,Fixture Selection and Special Item Ordering (PL1),"Determine type and quantity of plumbing fixtures (styles and colors), including: sinks (kitchen, baths, utility, wet bar, etc.), shower fixtures, toilets and toilet seats, exterior water spigots, water heater, garbage disposal, septic tank, sauna or steam room, water softener, refrigerator ice maker, and any other plumbing-related appliance. Order special plumbing fixtures well in advance, as supply houses rarely stock large quantities. (PL1 & PL4)",systems,plumbing
PL2,Bidding Management and Material Confirmation (PL2),"Conduct a standard bidding process. Shop prices carefully, as bids may vary significantly depending on material selections and the subcontractor’s pricing method. Decide on the type of piping to be used during this step. (PL2)",systems,plumbing
PL3,Coordination of Site Walkthrough and Utility Planning (PL3),"Walk through the site with the plumber to confirm placement of plumbing systems and any special fixtures. Account for exterior finish (e.g., brick veneer), as this affects the extension of exterior faucets. Also, mark the location of all fixtures (sinks, tubs, showers, toilets, outdoor spigots, wet bars, icemakers, utility tubs, washers, and water heater). Note vanity vs. pedestal sinks, drain end of tubs, and wall/ceiling areas to avoid for pipe runs (e.g., recessed lights or medicine cabinets). Apply for water connection and sewer tap, pay any required tap fee, and record the water meter number. Ask the plumber for a garden hose adapter for the water main. (PL3, PL5 & PL8)",systems,plumbing
PL4,Stub Plumbing and Large Fixture Placement Before Framing (PL4),"Install stub plumbing before concrete slab is poured—after batter boards and strings are set—and confirm sewer line location. Place all large fixtures (e.g., large tubs, fiberglass shower stalls, hot tubs) before framing begins to avoid clearance issues. Consider chaining expensive fixtures to studs or pipes for security. (PL6 & PL7)",systems,plumbing
PL5,"Rough-In Plumbing Installation, Protection, and Testing Oversight (PL5)","Install rough-in plumbing: hot (left) and cold (right) water lines, sewer, and vent pipe. Pipes should run through drilled holes in studs (not notched), with all required supports in place. Use FHA metal straps to protect pipes from being punctured by drywall nails at cut-outs. Exterior spigots should not be located near pipe penetrations through the exterior wall—this prevents leaks from freezing or failure. Extend spigots outward to accommodate brick veneer. Conduct air-pressure testing on water pipes to ensure no leaks. Install the water meter and spigot early to provide masons with a water source. Mark pipe locations (especially water and gas lines) to avoid damage during digging. (PL9, PL10, PL11 & PL13)",systems,plumbing
PL6,"Rough-In Inspection, Corrections, and Payment Authorization (PL6)","Schedule the plumbing inspector and be present during the inspection. No plumbing should be concealed before a rough-in certificate is issued. Use this opportunity to understand any required corrections and assess the plumber's workmanship. Correct any problems found using the power of county enforcement and leverage (i.e., plumber hasn’t been paid yet). Once approved, pay the plumber for rough-in and obtain a signed receipt or equivalent documentation. (PL12, PL14, PL15 & PL16)",systems,plumbing
PL7,Final Fixture Installation and System Performance Testing (PL7),"Install all previously selected fixtures: sinks, faucets, toilets, and shower heads.

EL1,"Electrical: Determine requirements, fixtures, appliances, and bidding","Determine electrical requirements by deciding where to place lighting fixtures, outlets, and switches. Make sure no switches are blocked by a door, and consider furniture placement. Even if your blueprint has an electrical diagram, verify or improve it. Investigate low voltage and fluorescent lighting, keeping in mind that fluorescent lights cannot be dimmed. Select electrical fixtures and appliances by visiting lighting distributor showrooms, looking especially for energy-saving fluorescent options (though these cannot use a dimmer). Place special orders early, and test the doorbell sound before buying. Conduct a standard bidding process, obtaining pricing for installing each outlet, switch, and fixture. Electricians typically charge extra for wiring the service panel and any special work; use only a licensed electrician. (EL1, EL2, EL4)",systems,electrical
EL2,Electrical: Arrange phone wiring and jack installations,"Determine if the phone company charges to wire the home for a modular phone system and how much they charge. Even if you plan on using wireless phones, install phone jacks in several locations. Schedule the phone company (or an electrician, if it’s cheaper) to install modular phone wiring and jacks. Also consider transferring your existing phone number to your new home so you can keep the same number. (EL3, EL5)",systems,electrical
EL3,Electrical: Secure temporary hookup and install pole,"Apply for and obtain permission to hook up the temporary pole to the public power system, possibly placing a deposit.

EL4,"Electrical: Oversee rough-in wiring (electrical, phone, cable, security)","Perform rough-in electrical by running wiring through wall studs and ceiling joists. Mark locations where outlets and switches should go, or the electrician will place them at his discretion. Provide blocking near outlets if necessary. This ensures that lights, switches, and outlets align with furniture and other planned elements. Install modular phone wiring and jacks, as well as any other desired wiring, such as speaker, cable TV, security, or computer lines. Pre-wiring is much easier now than after the walls are closed up. Many security system contractors pre-wire for free if you purchase their system. (EL8, EL9)",systems,electrical
EL5,"Electrical: Schedule rough-in inspection, corrections, and payment","Schedule the electrical inspection (usually done by the electrician). Once the county inspector reviews and signs off on the rough-in wiring, correct any issues they note. After the inspection is passed and any corrections are made, pay the electrical subcontractor for the rough-in work, keeping a receipt or proof of payment. (EL10, EL11, EL12, EL13)",systems,electrical
EL6,Electrical: Coordinate garage doors and electric openers,"Install garage doors first (often handled by a specialist, not the electrician).
