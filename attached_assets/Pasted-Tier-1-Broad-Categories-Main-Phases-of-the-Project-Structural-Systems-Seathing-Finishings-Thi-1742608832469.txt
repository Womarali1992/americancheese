Tier 1: Broad Categories (Main Phases of the Project)
Structural

Systems

Seathing

Finishings

This is the top-level categorization, where we define the main phases or broad areas of construction. These categories give you an overarching view of the entire project and how it can be broken down into different segments. Each of these categories represents a major part of the construction process.

Tier 2: Sections within Each Category (Specific Areas of Work)
Under each broad category, we break down the tasks further into more specific areas of work. These are the sections that highlight different aspects or components within each major category.

For example:
